# Side-Project-DNA
This was originally written in Lua/Luau, but the CodeSpace interpreter was fighting me so I switched to Python since its interpreter is way more reliable than the slop written for Lua/Luau. This is probably poorly written as this is one of the first times I'm using Python for its classes. I am more familiar with Lua/Luau (a modified version of Lua), so the code will probably not be in an industry standard format.

Executable files will probably be included for the final download for Windows. Also, keep in mind that this is one of my first experiences using Python's Tkinter library for this as well, so there may be severe optimization issues.

I'm writing this program because conversion of DNA and RNA takes me far too long for my Biology homework. I also think this is a good exercise for remembering this for the next quiz on this material. Also, this may be my alternative to my AP CSP portfolio thing since the graphing calculator equation interpreter is so tiring to figure out. That thing is like trying to teach a toddler set theory and linear algebra.
